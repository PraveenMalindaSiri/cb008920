        <h1>Why Canada is riddled with wildfires that burn year-round</h1>
        <p>Even at -40C (-40F), smoke kept billowing from under the snow. All through the winter, Marty Wells, a wolf trapper and fire crew leader, would see plumes of white as he drove north out of Fort Nelson, British Columbia in Canada. He found melt holes venting like hot springs, and flames licking at the foot of white-encrusted trees in the muskeg bogs. In places the ground was burning a foot (30cm) deep or more.

        "It gets in the muskeg and burns the muskeg and then it crawls, it creeps underground is what happens, and then pops up somewhere else," Wells says.
        
        When the snow melted in early May, these smouldering fires, often called "zombie" fires, came to life again and began to feed on dry trees and brush. The plumes of smoke north of Fort Nelson became a conflagration of 700 sq km (270 sq miles). The town is now caught in a horseshoe of fire: to the east, another zombie fire has burned an even larger area, while to the west, a new wildfire has encroached to within 2.5km (1.6 miles) of the community, damaging properties. Residents have been evacuated. Wells says he didn't expect the fire to get this bad. "It just happened that day that we had really high winds and right conditions and away it went."
        
        Canada's boreal zone – a mixture of forest and wetlands – makes up more than half of its land area. Wildfires burned a record 185,000 sq km (71,429 sq miles) of the country in 2023, an area the size of Syria. In western Canada, many of these fires went underground and smouldered until this spring, which fire services refer to as "overwintering" or "holdover" fires.
        </p><br>
        <p>Much of Canada is in its third year of drought, with the western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories the worst hit. Snowpack, the main source of water, was 37% lower than normal in British Columbia this winter, and powerful rivers shrivelled into thin veins of blue. As the snow melted and windy weather arrived to fan the flames in April and May, these zombie fires tore into a smorgasbord of dry fuel. With hotspots flaring up around old burn areas in north-west Alberta, the province had to declare an early start to the fire season on 20 February, rather than the usual 1 March.

        Mike Flannigan, a professor of wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia who has been monitoring fires there since the 1970s, says he's never seen an outbreak of zombie fires like this one. "This year, it's extremely significant," he says. "British Columbia has hundreds of thousands of hectares burned, and most of those are due to overwintering fires."
        
        Scientists believe that zombie fires are becoming more common, and that they are a symptom of the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires due to human-caused climate warming. But these fires also kick off the fire season earlier and could potentially result in more carbon emissions per area burned.
        
        "They're leading to significant emissions, significant fire growth the following year," Flannigan says. "As long as conditions are right, dry, it will continue to burn and burn."
        
        The power of peat
        Behind two sets of thick metal doors in Imperial College London, there's a race on, and the dried peat is winning. Peat is the dark, damp soil that forms when dead plant matter piles up in waterlogged, oxygen-poor environments like the bogs of Canada, Russia or Scotland. Because this matter can't fully decompose, it's rich in carbon, making it potentially potent fuel for zombie fires. It just depends on how wet it is.
        
        In their "Hazelab," Guillermo Rein, a professor of fire science, and his graduate students have filled two square, foil-wrapped ceramic containers with Canadian peat and ignited the back ends with glowing hot wires. Because of the limited oxygen content within the soil, they're smouldering, or burning without a flame. White smoke wafts out as the fire creeps forward through the brown peat. The lab takes on a smell like Scotch whisky. The peat in the container on the left is unaltered, with a moisture content of about 100%. The peat on the right was dried out in an oven to less than 1% moisture. After about two hours of burning, only a quarter of the moist peat has burned, versus more than half of the dry peat. "This is the natural, pristine condition," Rein says, pointing to the moist peat. "It can still burn, but it's relatively easy to stop because it's propagating so slowly."
        
        Next he gestures to the dry peat. "Now imagine that someone has drained the peatland, or that climate change has arrived and it's a really, really dry year. And this is the situation."
        
        It's the same situation in drought-stricken western Canada. As last year's gigantic fires – some started by humans, some by lightning – burned through the forests, they ignited dried-out peat below. And once peat starts burning, it can go for months, burning up to five metres (16.4ft) below the surface and creeping through the soil. Normally, firefighters in the remote expanses of Alaska, Canada and Siberia rely on the icy grip of winter to put out wildfires. But in peat, winter doesn't always stop the burn. Behind the two ceramic containers in Hazelab is a glass-doored refrigerator where Rein has performed similar peat-burning experiments. "It doesn't care about the cold weather," he says. Even at -20C (-4F), the fire keeps smouldering. "It's very scary, actually."

        <h1>A super-charged hurricane season is brewing – here's what it might look like</h1>
        <h3>Forecasters are predicting that 2024's hurricane season could be among the most active on record. To understand what a super hurricane season is like, we spoke to people who have already lived through one.</h3>
        <p>In one wild night, the hurricane came and went. As soon as evacuee Cheyne Weir woke up, he headed back into town. He drove past giant billboards blown bare by the wind. Then trailer park homes, each one looking like a bomb had gone off inside. He passed trees stripped of their bark, their trunks now freshly wrapped in sheet metal – roofing moulded like mere tinfoil by the wind.

        It was in the early hours of 27 August 2020 that Hurricane Laura ploughed through Lake Charles, Louisiana, causing damage on a scale that few of the city's residents had ever seen before. Now that the danger had passed, Weir was on his way back to his house, to find out what was left.
        
        That same morning, Denise Durel and Tami Chrisope from United Way of Southwest Louisiana, a social services charity, were also driving through the streets of the city, dodging huge pieces of fallen debris. Durel, president and chief executive, was behind the wheel while Chrisope held her smartphone out of the passenger window, capturing footage of the destruction and broadcasting it live on social media. "Can you drive past my house?" people kept asking, desperate to know if their home had survived.
        
        And downtown, Nic Hunter, the Mayor of Lake Charles, stepped through the heart of his city, looking around in disbelief. One of the tallest buildings in Lake Charles, a 22-storey office tower, had many windows blown out. It sat there, dishevelled. A giant block of Swiss cheese, he thought, riddled with holes.
        
        When Weir finally made it to the modern townhouse where he lived with his then-fiancée Leighanna, he was thankful to see it was still standing. But opening the front door revealed the destruction inside. Severe damage to the roof had allowed a deluge of rainwater through. There were inches of water in the ground floor. "I can't show you… It's bad, it's really bad," Weir remembers saying to his fiancée on Facetime, declining to turn the phone around.
        
        The Atlantic hurricane season runs from 1 June to 30 November each year and 2020 holds the title of the most active hurricane season on record in terms of the number of storms. That year, there were 30 named storms. Tropical cyclones get named when they can maintain one-minute wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h) or more. In 2020, the tally included 13 hurricanes, six of which were major hurricanes – reaching categories 3-5 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, with sustained windspeeds greater than 111mph (179km/h).
        
        Hurricane Laura was devastating, racking up more than $23bn (£18bn) of damage and claiming the lives of 81 people, mostly in Haiti and Louisiana. Plus, Lake Charles wasn't just hit once. A little over a month later, Hurricane Delta arrived. "Laura took a home and weakened it, Delta came through and flattened it," says Durel.
        
        Now, fears are growing that 2024 will bring another onslaught of extreme weather to communities in the Caribbean and US, because early forecasts indicate this year's hurricane season will also be extremely active. At this stage, weather experts expect multiple named storms to emerge and the chance of the most destructive Category 4 and 5 hurricanes making landfall is raised, they say. (Read BBC News' report on the forecast.)
        
        Climate change is increasing the likelihood of what could be classed as "super hurricane seasons", like the one in 2020. The people of Lake Charles can tell you what living through a super season feels like. The city became famous for having endured not just the two hurricanes but also a winter ice storm and severe flooding the following spring – not to mention the global Covid-19 pandemic, which was at its height during this period. Three years on from the storms, there are still homes in Lake Charles bereft of roofs, covered only by tarp, and some particularly badly damaged buildings yet to be torn down.
        
        "I am a faithful and God-fearing man," says Hunter, the city's mayor, recalling that dreadful period. "I started to ask God, 'What more can we go through and when will this end?'"
        </p><br>
        <p>In April, meteorologists at Colorado State University (CSU) put out a sobering early forecast for the 2024 hurricane season. At that stage, they expected a total of 11 hurricanes, including five major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher, and more than 20 named storms in total. All of these numbers are well above the average hurricane season activity of the past 30 years.

        "I can tell you right now I'm talking to an emergency management group in about 40 minutes," Phil Klotzbach of CSU told the BBC. "There's very heightened interest in the season."
        
        Even more severe warnings have since followed that April forecast. Expect the coming hurricane season to be "extraordinary", said the director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) during a news conference in late May.
        
        Noaa's latest outlook suggests up to 13 hurricanes could emerge this year, with seven of them potentially reaching Category 3 or higher. Overall, the agency says there is an 85% chance that the season will be "above normal" in terms of storm activity. It adds that, this year, it will upgrade its use of unmanned sailing and underwater drones to track hurricanes in real time.
        
        Separately, The Weather Company also recently forecast a "hyperactive" Atlantic hurricane season.
        
        The sharpness of these projections is driven in large part by the unusually high temperature of the North Atlantic, which is currently around 1C (1.8F) higher than the average temperature for this time of year since 1991. This May, the waters of the Tropical Atlantic are as warm as you might expect them to be in August. Global sea surface temperatures have set new records every day over the past 12 months.
        
        Extra heat helps to drive the formation of large storms over the Atlantic. Plus, a crucial, cyclical change appears to be occurring in the Earth's climate – a shift from what's called El Niño to La Niña. La Niña means cooler waters in the south-eastern Pacific, which affects winds right across the US and over the Atlantic Ocean, too. It ultimately means less wind shear, or a smaller variance between wind speeds at different altitudes, over the Atlantic. And that lack of turbulence or disruption in the air makes it easier for hurricanes to grow into gargantuan storm systems. (Learn more about the birthplace of the most destructive hurricanes.)
        
        Climate change isn't just bringing more and bigger storms, it is also increasing the possibility of storms suddenly stepping up in power. This is a process called rapid intensification and it happened to Hurricane Laura in 2020, transforming the threat that it posed to Louisiana in the hours before it struck Lake Charles. An extraordinary case of rapid intensification also occurred in 2023 when Hurricane Lee was supercharged in just 24 hours from a Category 1 to a Category 5 storm, reaching wind speeds of 165mph (266km/h). Thankfully, Lee was nowhere near land when this happened. But meteorologists consider it a warning.
        
        "That is the nightmare scenario," says Brian Tang, a hurricane researcher at the University at Albany, New York. "The combination of a major hurricane headed towards a populated area with not enough time to evacuate."
        
        A number of hurricanes and typhoons have already reached hypothetical 'Category 6' status
        Michael Wehner, who studies extreme weather events at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in California, agrees that this prospect is "terrifying". He points to a study published in May 2024, which suggests the chances not just of rapid intensification but near-shore rapid intensification, specifically, are rising. According to the study, this is because the warming climate is reducing wind shear and increasing relative humidity – both these factors may help hurricanes to explode in power when approaching land.
        
        Not only that, the biggest storms are arguably getting even bigger. Last year, Wehner and a colleague published a paper where they argued that a new level should be added to the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, to more accurately represent the most extreme storms. Several hurricanes and typhoons already satisfy the criteria for hypothetical "Category 6" status, having had one-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 192mph – such as Hurricane Patricia in 2015.
        
        Our tools for communicating the scale and impact of hurricanes aren't always effective enough, suggests Wehner. He gives the examples of Hurricane Camille in 1969 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Both were Category 5 storms but the latter was significantly larger and more deadly.
        
        "Katrina was enormous," says Wehner. "There were people who died because they said, 'Well, I survived Camille. That was a [Category] 5, how bad can it be?' – but they just were different." While Camille claimed an estimated 259 lives, more than 1,800 people died during Katrina.
        
        The 2005 hurricane season is important to consider as an example of what the future might hold because it is the only season on record to have surpassed 2020 in terms of the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes. In total, after 27 named storms, including 15 hurricanes and seven major hurricanes, the 2005 season caused more than 3,400 deaths in the US and Central America, and $160bn (£90bn) worth of damage. The 2020 season, by comparison, led to damages of $37bn (£29bn) and around 430 deaths.
        
        When it comes to weighing up the threat posed by a hurricane, or deciding whether to evacuate or not, people sometimes fixate on the wind speeds, says Tang. But it's water that can do the most harm. "The danger of hurricanes is the water hazards – the [storm] surge and the flooding," he says, as 88% of fatalities from tropical cyclones in the US are water-related.
        
        And Wehner says climate change is also making hurricanes wetter. For every degree Celsius warmer the air is, these giant storms can hold about 7% more water but, crucially, the rate at which they can dump that water out goes up much faster, at around 14-21% per degree Celsius, Wehner explains. In other words, the storms can hold a little more moisture – but produce a lot more rain.

        <h1>The tunnels, trails and bridges built especially for bears</h1>
        <h3>To truly thrive, bears and other wild animals need to roam widely between habitats. Wildlife tunnels, trails and bridges can help – but are they enough?</h3>
        <p>n the north-west of the US, a rocky green and grey landscape juts and curves its way north to Canada, and south to Mexico. These are the Rocky Mountains, home to roving wolverine, majestic elk – and several hundred grizzly bears, whose population has been recovering thanks to efforts to reconnect their habitat so they can roam more freely.

            Though huge – the tallest mountain is over 4,400m (14,436ft) high, and the range stretches a full 4,800km (2,983 miles) – the Rocky Mountains are not the wild expanse of land they once were. Towns and cities have formed in valleys, and roads have cut across the land to connect them. For wildlife, and especially the bears, this creates a problem.
            
            Bears need space to thrive – lots of it. A typical grizzly bear needs 130 to 1,554 sq km (50 to 600 sq miles) to find appropriate food and meet new mates. They look for deer by the river, catch fish in mountain creeks, and forage grasses, bulbs and berries in forests and on mountain sides. A 2014 study followed a grizzly bear called Ethyl as she wound her way 2,800 miles (4,506 km) through Montana, into Idaho, and up to the border with British Columbia. But safe, connected stretches of wilderness have become hard to find, says Mark Hebblewhite, professor of Ungulate Habitat Ecology at the University of Montana, who has spent his career studying the animal inhabitants of the Rocky Mountains' peaks and valleys.
            
            "I'm here walking above the city of Missoula, a little city of 50,000 people," he says,  speaking on his mobile while out on a hike. "And I see a new development going in that's going to carve up another 600 acres (2.43 sq km) with 200 homes". These homes are needed – but they are an example of how the world's biggest, most expansive ecosystems become fragmented as humans move in.
            
        </p><br>
        <p>Helping animals roam and connect
            One solution is to help bears and other wildlife cross from one protected area to the next. This can be done with something as simple as a highway underpass or overpass, researchers say – a kind of bear tunnel, or bear bridge. Another solution is to prevent an area from being turned into roads and housing, so it can connect two protected areas even if it does not have protected status itself. Known as wildlife corridors, or ecological corridors, these connecting strips and areas are gaining more scientific attention. In recent years, they have begun to reconnect habitat for tigers in Nepal, bees in Britain and deer in the Netherlands. 
            
            Ecological corridors "are super important, because what research over time has shown is that most of our protected areas are too small to maintain all of the species and ecological processes within them," says Jodi Hilty, who has spent her career researching and creating such corridors. She is president and chief scientist at Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) – an initiative that aims to build connections between important habitats along the spine of the Rocky Mountains.
            
            The Yellowstone to Yukon region spans 1.3 million sq km (501,933 sq miles), stretching from Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park in the south to Canada's Yukon Territory in the north. Since the Yellowstone to Yukon initiative launched in 1993, its team of scientists and other experts have turned this vast tract of land from a disjointed patchwork of protected areas, into a more coherent, connected space for animals to roam. The area is now the most intact mountain region in the world, with 95% of its land classified as "wild" – though only about 16% of the overall region is protected land.
            
            A bear paradise
            Mountains are considered ideal for bears as their diverse landscape provides a range of foods for them, as well as shelter and safety away from humans. Roaming widely is the only way they can meet their broad dietary needs, Hebblewhite explains. "Grizzly bears are omnivores, so that means they eat meat and plants. That gives them great flexibility, because they can shift their diet over the season as different foods are available. But that also means they have to shift their use of space to take advantage of those new foods."

        <h1>The language that doesn't use 'no'</h1>
        <h3>Nepal's Kusunda language has no known origin and a number of quirks, like no words for "yes" or "no". It also has only one fluent speaker left, something linguists are racing to change.</h3>
        <p>
            Through the winter mist of the hills of the Terai, in lowland Nepal, 18-year-old Hima Kusunda emerges from the school's boarding house, snug in a pink hooded sweatshirt.
            Hima is one of the last remaining Kusunda, a tiny indigenous group now scattered across central western Nepal. Their language, also called Kusunda, is unique: it is believed by linguists to be unrelated to any other language in the world. Scholars still aren't sure how it originated. And it has a variety of unusual elements, including lacking any standard way of negating a sentence, words for "yes" or "no", or any words for direction.According to the latest Nepali census data from 2011, there are 273 Kusunda remaining. But only one woman, 48-year-old Kamala Khatri, is known to be fluent.

            The Kusunda are highly marginalised and impoverished within Nepali society. Today, most live in west Nepal's Dang district, a sleepy region of yellow mustard fields and misty, wooded hills. It is here the Language Commission of Nepal has been running Kusunda classes since 2019 in an effort to preserve the language. In the last decade, as the government of Nepal has launched schemes to help Nepal's indigenous groups, it has also begun paying for Hima and other Kusunda children from remote areas to board at Mahindra High School in Dang – sometimes as much as a 10-hour drive away – where they are also being taught their native language.
            
            Hima, originally from the rural Pyuthan district bordering Dang, has been learning Kusunda for two years. She now is able to speak it at a basic level. "Before coming to school in Dang, I didn't know any Kusunda language," she says. "But I am proud to know Kusunda now, even though I didn't learn it from birth.
            "I used to listen to other [ethnic groups], like Tharus and Magars, speaking their language, and wonder what it would be like to converse in my mother tongue. I think it is very important for me, and others, to protect this language."
        </p><br>
        <p>
            A language on the brink

            Originally semi-nomadic, the Kusunda lived in the jungles of west Nepal until the middle of the 20th Century, hunting birds and monitor lizards, and trading yams and meat for rice and flour in nearby towns. While they are now settled in villages, they still call themselves the Ban Rajas, or kings of the forest.
            
            But as Nepal's population grew and farming increasingly fragmented the jungles, pressure on the Kusundas' homeland increased. Then, in the 1950s, the government nationalised great swathes of forests, presenting further obstacles to their nomadic life.
            
            The Kusunda were forced to settle, turning to jobs in labouring and agriculture. Low numbers in the group and the disparate nature of their population meant they mostly married neighbouring ethnic groups. Almost all stopped speaking their language.
            
            For the Kusunda people, losing their language means losing a link to their past, and to their identity.
            
            From a linguistic point of view, it is a loss in other ways, too.
            
            Madhav Pokharel, emeritus professor of linguistics at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, has been overseeing the documentation of the Kusunda language over the last 15 years. He explains that several studies have attempted to link it with other language isolates, such as Burushaski from north Pakistan and Nihali from India. But all have failed to find any robust conclusions.

        <h1>The lost nuclear bombs that no one can find</h1>
        <h3>The US has lost at least three nuclear bombs that have never been located – they're still out there to this day. How did this happen? Where could they be? And will we ever find them?</h3>
        <p>It was a mild winter's morning at the height of the Cold War.

            On January 17, 1966, at around 10:30am, a Spanish shrimp fisherman watched a misshapen white parcel fall from the sky… and silently glide towards the Alboran Sea. It had something hanging beneath it, though he couldn’t make out what it was. Then it slipped beneath the waves.
            
            At the same time, in the nearby fishing village of Palomares, locals looked up at an identical sky and witnessed a very different scene – two giant fireballs, hurtling towards them. Within seconds, the sleepy rural idyll was shattered. Buildings shook. Shrapnel sliced towards the ground. Body parts fell to the earth. A few weeks later, Philip Meyers received a message via a teleprinter – a device that could send and receive primitive emails. At the time, he was working as a bomb disposal officer at the Naval Air Facility Sigonella, in eastern Sicily. He was told that there was a top secret emergency in Spain, and that he must report there within days. 

            However, the mission was not as covert as the military had hoped. "It was not a surprise to be called," says Meyers. Even the public knew what was going on. When he attended a dinner party that evening and announced his mysterious trip, its intended confidentiality became something of a joke. "It was kind of embarrassing," says Meyers. "It was supposed to be a secret but my friends were telling me why I was going."
            
            For weeks, newspapers around the globe had been reporting rumours of a terrible accident – two US military planes had collided in mid-air, scattering four B28 thermonuclear bombs across Palomares. Three were quickly recovered on land – but one had disappeared into the sparkling blue expanse to the south east, lost to the bottom of the nearby swathe of Mediterranean Sea. Now the hunt was on to find it – along with its 1.1 megatonne warhead, with the explosive power of 1,100,000 tonnes of TNT.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            An unknown number

            In fact, the Palomares incident is not the only time a nuclear weapon has been misplaced. There have been at least 32 so-called "broken arrow" accidents – those involving these catastrophically destructive, earth-flattening devices – since 1950. In many cases, the weapons were dropped by mistake or jettisoned during an emergency, then later recovered. But three US bombs have gone missing altogether – they're still out there to this day, lurking in swamps, fields and oceans across the planet.

            "We mostly know about the American cases," says Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Non-proliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Non-proliferation Studies, California. He explains that the full list only emerged when a summary prepared by the US Department of Defense was declassified in the 1980s.

            Many occurred during the Cold War, when the nation teetered on the precipice of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) with the Soviet Union – and consequently kept airplanes armed with nuclear weapons in the sky at all times from 1960 to 1968, in an operation known as Chrome Dome.

            "We don't know as much about other countries. We don't really know anything about the United Kingdom or France, or Russia or China," says Lewis. "So I don't think we have anything like a full accounting."

            The Soviet Union's nuclear past is particularly murky – it had amassed a stockpile of 45,000 nuclear weapons as of 1986. There are known cases where the country lost nuclear bombs that have never been retrieved, but unlike with the US incidents, they all occurred on submarines and their locations are known, if inaccessible.

            One began on 8 April 1970, when a fire started spreading through the air conditioning system of a Soviet K-8 nuclear-powered submarine while it was diving in the Bay of Biscay – a treacherous stretch of water in the northeast Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Spain and France, which is notorious for its violent storms and where many vessels have met their end. It had four nuclear torpedoes onboard, and when it promptly sank, it took its radioactive cargo with it.

            However, these lost vessels didn't always stay where they were. In 1968, a Soviet K-129 mysteriously sank in the Pacific Ocean northwest of Hawaii, along with three nuclear missiles. The US soon found out, and decided to mount a secret attempt to retrieve this nuclear prize, "which was really a pretty crazy story in and of itself", says Lewis.

        <h1>Call of Duty to go to Game Pass in gaming shake-up</h1>
        <p>Microsoft has torn up the rules of big video game launches by announcing its most eagerly awaited new title - Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - will be available straight away to subscribers of its Game Pass service.
            Traditionally, gamers have had to hand over significant sums of money upfront to buy big new releases outright.
            With the latest edition of Call of Duty, they will now have the option to pay a much smaller monthly subscription instead.
            GamesIndustry.biz head Christopher Dring told the BBC it was a "significant move" for Microsoft and the industry.
            The tech giant has previously made games available to Game Pass subscribers on launch day - such as 2023's much-anticipated Starfield - but has never done so with a release anywhere near as significant as Call of Duty.
            It is the fourth best-selling game series in history, topping 425m lifetime sales - and making tens of billions of dollars in the process.
            It is arguably the jewel in the crown of developer Activision Blizzard which Microsoft controversially bought for a colossal $69bn (then £56bn) in 2023.
            But rather than stick with the tried-and-tested model for selling it, Microsoft is gambling on a new approach.
            "Call of Duty is by far the biggest game to go into a subscription service on the day it is released," Mr Dring said.
            "IT is a big test for subscription, because if Call of Duty can't move the needle in terms of subscriber numbers, probably nothing will," he added.
            'Netflix for games'
            Game Pass, much like Sony's rival PlayStation Plus service, lets console and PC players play hundreds of video games for a monthly subscription fee.
            Both have been described as a "Netflix for games", but with the caveat that gamers can download many of the games available to play on their own hardware - rather than streaming over the cloud.
            They are extremely popular services, with Sony saying PlayStation Plus had 47m subscribers in March 2023, while Microsoft said Game Pass had 34m subscribers as of February 2024.
            But that means, unless something changes between now and Call of Duty's launch (which does not yet have a release date), not one of the 34 million Game Pass subscribers will have to pay anything extra to play the new game.
            This means Microsoft is taking a huge gamble, choosing to potentially cannibalise sales in exchange for - it hopes - a sharp increase to Game Pass subscribers.
            Mr Dring said the move probably came down to an inherent problem with game streaming services - people simply don't play as many games as they watch TV shows, so "it can be hard to justify" paying to play one or two titles.
            But with the addition of such a big game to the service, he said there may yet be changes coming to make the numbers work.
            "It'll be interesting to see whether Xbox will introduce higher tiers to Game Pass or other monetisation techniques to mitigate this," he said.
