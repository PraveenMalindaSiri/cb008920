        <h1>Why Canada is riddled with wildfires that burn year-round</h1>
        <p>Even at -40C (-40F), smoke kept billowing from under the snow. All through the winter, Marty Wells, a wolf trapper and fire crew leader, would see plumes of white as he drove north out of Fort Nelson, British Columbia in Canada. He found melt holes venting like hot springs, and flames licking at the foot of white-encrusted trees in the muskeg bogs. In places the ground was burning a foot (30cm) deep or more.

        "It gets in the muskeg and burns the muskeg and then it crawls, it creeps underground is what happens, and then pops up somewhere else," Wells says.
        
        When the snow melted in early May, these smouldering fires, often called "zombie" fires, came to life again and began to feed on dry trees and brush. The plumes of smoke north of Fort Nelson became a conflagration of 700 sq km (270 sq miles). The town is now caught in a horseshoe of fire: to the east, another zombie fire has burned an even larger area, while to the west, a new wildfire has encroached to within 2.5km (1.6 miles) of the community, damaging properties. Residents have been evacuated. Wells says he didn't expect the fire to get this bad. "It just happened that day that we had really high winds and right conditions and away it went."
        
        Canada's boreal zone – a mixture of forest and wetlands – makes up more than half of its land area. Wildfires burned a record 185,000 sq km (71,429 sq miles) of the country in 2023, an area the size of Syria. In western Canada, many of these fires went underground and smouldered until this spring, which fire services refer to as "overwintering" or "holdover" fires.
        </p><br>
        <p>Much of Canada is in its third year of drought, with the western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and the Northwest Territories the worst hit. Snowpack, the main source of water, was 37% lower than normal in British Columbia this winter, and powerful rivers shrivelled into thin veins of blue. As the snow melted and windy weather arrived to fan the flames in April and May, these zombie fires tore into a smorgasbord of dry fuel. With hotspots flaring up around old burn areas in north-west Alberta, the province had to declare an early start to the fire season on 20 February, rather than the usual 1 March.

        Mike Flannigan, a professor of wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia who has been monitoring fires there since the 1970s, says he's never seen an outbreak of zombie fires like this one. "This year, it's extremely significant," he says. "British Columbia has hundreds of thousands of hectares burned, and most of those are due to overwintering fires."
        
        Scientists believe that zombie fires are becoming more common, and that they are a symptom of the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires due to human-caused climate warming. But these fires also kick off the fire season earlier and could potentially result in more carbon emissions per area burned.
        
        "They're leading to significant emissions, significant fire growth the following year," Flannigan says. "As long as conditions are right, dry, it will continue to burn and burn."
        
        The power of peat
        Behind two sets of thick metal doors in Imperial College London, there's a race on, and the dried peat is winning. Peat is the dark, damp soil that forms when dead plant matter piles up in waterlogged, oxygen-poor environments like the bogs of Canada, Russia or Scotland. Because this matter can't fully decompose, it's rich in carbon, making it potentially potent fuel for zombie fires. It just depends on how wet it is.
        
        In their "Hazelab," Guillermo Rein, a professor of fire science, and his graduate students have filled two square, foil-wrapped ceramic containers with Canadian peat and ignited the back ends with glowing hot wires. Because of the limited oxygen content within the soil, they're smouldering, or burning without a flame. White smoke wafts out as the fire creeps forward through the brown peat. The lab takes on a smell like Scotch whisky. The peat in the container on the left is unaltered, with a moisture content of about 100%. The peat on the right was dried out in an oven to less than 1% moisture. After about two hours of burning, only a quarter of the moist peat has burned, versus more than half of the dry peat. "This is the natural, pristine condition," Rein says, pointing to the moist peat. "It can still burn, but it's relatively easy to stop because it's propagating so slowly."
        
        Next he gestures to the dry peat. "Now imagine that someone has drained the peatland, or that climate change has arrived and it's a really, really dry year. And this is the situation."
        
        It's the same situation in drought-stricken western Canada. As last year's gigantic fires – some started by humans, some by lightning – burned through the forests, they ignited dried-out peat below. And once peat starts burning, it can go for months, burning up to five metres (16.4ft) below the surface and creeping through the soil. Normally, firefighters in the remote expanses of Alaska, Canada and Siberia rely on the icy grip of winter to put out wildfires. But in peat, winter doesn't always stop the burn. Behind the two ceramic containers in Hazelab is a glass-doored refrigerator where Rein has performed similar peat-burning experiments. "It doesn't care about the cold weather," he says. Even at -20C (-4F), the fire keeps smouldering. "It's very scary, actually."

        <h1>A super-charged hurricane season is brewing – here's what it might look like</h1>
        <h3>Forecasters are predicting that 2024's hurricane season could be among the most active on record. To understand what a super hurricane season is like, we spoke to people who have already lived through one.</h3>
        <p>In one wild night, the hurricane came and went. As soon as evacuee Cheyne Weir woke up, he headed back into town. He drove past giant billboards blown bare by the wind. Then trailer park homes, each one looking like a bomb had gone off inside. He passed trees stripped of their bark, their trunks now freshly wrapped in sheet metal – roofing moulded like mere tinfoil by the wind.

        It was in the early hours of 27 August 2020 that Hurricane Laura ploughed through Lake Charles, Louisiana, causing damage on a scale that few of the city's residents had ever seen before. Now that the danger had passed, Weir was on his way back to his house, to find out what was left.
        
        That same morning, Denise Durel and Tami Chrisope from United Way of Southwest Louisiana, a social services charity, were also driving through the streets of the city, dodging huge pieces of fallen debris. Durel, president and chief executive, was behind the wheel while Chrisope held her smartphone out of the passenger window, capturing footage of the destruction and broadcasting it live on social media. "Can you drive past my house?" people kept asking, desperate to know if their home had survived.
        
        And downtown, Nic Hunter, the Mayor of Lake Charles, stepped through the heart of his city, looking around in disbelief. One of the tallest buildings in Lake Charles, a 22-storey office tower, had many windows blown out. It sat there, dishevelled. A giant block of Swiss cheese, he thought, riddled with holes.
        
        When Weir finally made it to the modern townhouse where he lived with his then-fiancée Leighanna, he was thankful to see it was still standing. But opening the front door revealed the destruction inside. Severe damage to the roof had allowed a deluge of rainwater through. There were inches of water in the ground floor. "I can't show you… It's bad, it's really bad," Weir remembers saying to his fiancée on Facetime, declining to turn the phone around.
        
        The Atlantic hurricane season runs from 1 June to 30 November each year and 2020 holds the title of the most active hurricane season on record in terms of the number of storms. That year, there were 30 named storms. Tropical cyclones get named when they can maintain one-minute wind speeds of 39 mph (63 km/h) or more. In 2020, the tally included 13 hurricanes, six of which were major hurricanes – reaching categories 3-5 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, with sustained windspeeds greater than 111mph (179km/h).
        
        Hurricane Laura was devastating, racking up more than $23bn (£18bn) of damage and claiming the lives of 81 people, mostly in Haiti and Louisiana. Plus, Lake Charles wasn't just hit once. A little over a month later, Hurricane Delta arrived. "Laura took a home and weakened it, Delta came through and flattened it," says Durel.
        
        Now, fears are growing that 2024 will bring another onslaught of extreme weather to communities in the Caribbean and US, because early forecasts indicate this year's hurricane season will also be extremely active. At this stage, weather experts expect multiple named storms to emerge and the chance of the most destructive Category 4 and 5 hurricanes making landfall is raised, they say. (Read BBC News' report on the forecast.)
        
        Climate change is increasing the likelihood of what could be classed as "super hurricane seasons", like the one in 2020. The people of Lake Charles can tell you what living through a super season feels like. The city became famous for having endured not just the two hurricanes but also a winter ice storm and severe flooding the following spring – not to mention the global Covid-19 pandemic, which was at its height during this period. Three years on from the storms, there are still homes in Lake Charles bereft of roofs, covered only by tarp, and some particularly badly damaged buildings yet to be torn down.
        
        "I am a faithful and God-fearing man," says Hunter, the city's mayor, recalling that dreadful period. "I started to ask God, 'What more can we go through and when will this end?'"
        </p><br>
        <p>In April, meteorologists at Colorado State University (CSU) put out a sobering early forecast for the 2024 hurricane season. At that stage, they expected a total of 11 hurricanes, including five major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher, and more than 20 named storms in total. All of these numbers are well above the average hurricane season activity of the past 30 years.

        "I can tell you right now I'm talking to an emergency management group in about 40 minutes," Phil Klotzbach of CSU told the BBC. "There's very heightened interest in the season."
        
        Even more severe warnings have since followed that April forecast. Expect the coming hurricane season to be "extraordinary", said the director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) during a news conference in late May.
        
        Noaa's latest outlook suggests up to 13 hurricanes could emerge this year, with seven of them potentially reaching Category 3 or higher. Overall, the agency says there is an 85% chance that the season will be "above normal" in terms of storm activity. It adds that, this year, it will upgrade its use of unmanned sailing and underwater drones to track hurricanes in real time.
        
        Separately, The Weather Company also recently forecast a "hyperactive" Atlantic hurricane season.
        
        The sharpness of these projections is driven in large part by the unusually high temperature of the North Atlantic, which is currently around 1C (1.8F) higher than the average temperature for this time of year since 1991. This May, the waters of the Tropical Atlantic are as warm as you might expect them to be in August. Global sea surface temperatures have set new records every day over the past 12 months.
        
        Extra heat helps to drive the formation of large storms over the Atlantic. Plus, a crucial, cyclical change appears to be occurring in the Earth's climate – a shift from what's called El Niño to La Niña. La Niña means cooler waters in the south-eastern Pacific, which affects winds right across the US and over the Atlantic Ocean, too. It ultimately means less wind shear, or a smaller variance between wind speeds at different altitudes, over the Atlantic. And that lack of turbulence or disruption in the air makes it easier for hurricanes to grow into gargantuan storm systems. (Learn more about the birthplace of the most destructive hurricanes.)
        
        Climate change isn't just bringing more and bigger storms, it is also increasing the possibility of storms suddenly stepping up in power. This is a process called rapid intensification and it happened to Hurricane Laura in 2020, transforming the threat that it posed to Louisiana in the hours before it struck Lake Charles. An extraordinary case of rapid intensification also occurred in 2023 when Hurricane Lee was supercharged in just 24 hours from a Category 1 to a Category 5 storm, reaching wind speeds of 165mph (266km/h). Thankfully, Lee was nowhere near land when this happened. But meteorologists consider it a warning.
        
        "That is the nightmare scenario," says Brian Tang, a hurricane researcher at the University at Albany, New York. "The combination of a major hurricane headed towards a populated area with not enough time to evacuate."
        
        A number of hurricanes and typhoons have already reached hypothetical 'Category 6' status
        Michael Wehner, who studies extreme weather events at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in California, agrees that this prospect is "terrifying". He points to a study published in May 2024, which suggests the chances not just of rapid intensification but near-shore rapid intensification, specifically, are rising. According to the study, this is because the warming climate is reducing wind shear and increasing relative humidity – both these factors may help hurricanes to explode in power when approaching land.
        
        Not only that, the biggest storms are arguably getting even bigger. Last year, Wehner and a colleague published a paper where they argued that a new level should be added to the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, to more accurately represent the most extreme storms. Several hurricanes and typhoons already satisfy the criteria for hypothetical "Category 6" status, having had one-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 192mph – such as Hurricane Patricia in 2015.
        
        Our tools for communicating the scale and impact of hurricanes aren't always effective enough, suggests Wehner. He gives the examples of Hurricane Camille in 1969 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Both were Category 5 storms but the latter was significantly larger and more deadly.
        
        "Katrina was enormous," says Wehner. "There were people who died because they said, 'Well, I survived Camille. That was a [Category] 5, how bad can it be?' – but they just were different." While Camille claimed an estimated 259 lives, more than 1,800 people died during Katrina.
        
        The 2005 hurricane season is important to consider as an example of what the future might hold because it is the only season on record to have surpassed 2020 in terms of the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes. In total, after 27 named storms, including 15 hurricanes and seven major hurricanes, the 2005 season caused more than 3,400 deaths in the US and Central America, and $160bn (£90bn) worth of damage. The 2020 season, by comparison, led to damages of $37bn (£29bn) and around 430 deaths.
        
        When it comes to weighing up the threat posed by a hurricane, or deciding whether to evacuate or not, people sometimes fixate on the wind speeds, says Tang. But it's water that can do the most harm. "The danger of hurricanes is the water hazards – the [storm] surge and the flooding," he says, as 88% of fatalities from tropical cyclones in the US are water-related.
        
        And Wehner says climate change is also making hurricanes wetter. For every degree Celsius warmer the air is, these giant storms can hold about 7% more water but, crucially, the rate at which they can dump that water out goes up much faster, at around 14-21% per degree Celsius, Wehner explains. In other words, the storms can hold a little more moisture – but produce a lot more rain.

        <h1>The tunnels, trails and bridges built especially for bears</h1>
        <h3>To truly thrive, bears and other wild animals need to roam widely between habitats. Wildlife tunnels, trails and bridges can help – but are they enough?</h3>
        <p>n the north-west of the US, a rocky green and grey landscape juts and curves its way north to Canada, and south to Mexico. These are the Rocky Mountains, home to roving wolverine, majestic elk – and several hundred grizzly bears, whose population has been recovering thanks to efforts to reconnect their habitat so they can roam more freely.

            Though huge – the tallest mountain is over 4,400m (14,436ft) high, and the range stretches a full 4,800km (2,983 miles) – the Rocky Mountains are not the wild expanse of land they once were. Towns and cities have formed in valleys, and roads have cut across the land to connect them. For wildlife, and especially the bears, this creates a problem.
            
            Bears need space to thrive – lots of it. A typical grizzly bear needs 130 to 1,554 sq km (50 to 600 sq miles) to find appropriate food and meet new mates. They look for deer by the river, catch fish in mountain creeks, and forage grasses, bulbs and berries in forests and on mountain sides. A 2014 study followed a grizzly bear called Ethyl as she wound her way 2,800 miles (4,506 km) through Montana, into Idaho, and up to the border with British Columbia. But safe, connected stretches of wilderness have become hard to find, says Mark Hebblewhite, professor of Ungulate Habitat Ecology at the University of Montana, who has spent his career studying the animal inhabitants of the Rocky Mountains' peaks and valleys.
            
            "I'm here walking above the city of Missoula, a little city of 50,000 people," he says,  speaking on his mobile while out on a hike. "And I see a new development going in that's going to carve up another 600 acres (2.43 sq km) with 200 homes". These homes are needed – but they are an example of how the world's biggest, most expansive ecosystems become fragmented as humans move in.
            
        </p><br>
        <p>Helping animals roam and connect
            One solution is to help bears and other wildlife cross from one protected area to the next. This can be done with something as simple as a highway underpass or overpass, researchers say – a kind of bear tunnel, or bear bridge. Another solution is to prevent an area from being turned into roads and housing, so it can connect two protected areas even if it does not have protected status itself. Known as wildlife corridors, or ecological corridors, these connecting strips and areas are gaining more scientific attention. In recent years, they have begun to reconnect habitat for tigers in Nepal, bees in Britain and deer in the Netherlands. 
            
            Ecological corridors "are super important, because what research over time has shown is that most of our protected areas are too small to maintain all of the species and ecological processes within them," says Jodi Hilty, who has spent her career researching and creating such corridors. She is president and chief scientist at Yellowstone to Yukon (Y2Y) – an initiative that aims to build connections between important habitats along the spine of the Rocky Mountains.
            
            The Yellowstone to Yukon region spans 1.3 million sq km (501,933 sq miles), stretching from Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park in the south to Canada's Yukon Territory in the north. Since the Yellowstone to Yukon initiative launched in 1993, its team of scientists and other experts have turned this vast tract of land from a disjointed patchwork of protected areas, into a more coherent, connected space for animals to roam. The area is now the most intact mountain region in the world, with 95% of its land classified as "wild" – though only about 16% of the overall region is protected land.
            
            A bear paradise
            Mountains are considered ideal for bears as their diverse landscape provides a range of foods for them, as well as shelter and safety away from humans. Roaming widely is the only way they can meet their broad dietary needs, Hebblewhite explains. "Grizzly bears are omnivores, so that means they eat meat and plants. That gives them great flexibility, because they can shift their diet over the season as different foods are available. But that also means they have to shift their use of space to take advantage of those new foods."
